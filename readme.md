This Chrome extension finds subheds on the BBC & NPR websites and replaces them with topical limericks generated by OpenAI's text-Davinci-003 language model.

To run, this extension needs an OpenAI API key. Insert yours inside the single-quotes on line 48 of limerick.js â€“ you can generate one at https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys
